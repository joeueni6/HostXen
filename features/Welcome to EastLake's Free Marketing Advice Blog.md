## A Fresh Start: Blogging Again

Back in 2010, after launching my marketing agency, I started a daily blog. With fewer clients back then, I had the time to consistently post about marketing and sales. My blog gained a lot of popularity, as blogging was a hallmark of credibility for small businesses during that time.

While having a blog is no longer a necessity for establishing expertise, it remains a valuable toolâ€”especially for startups and micro businesses. Potential customers are inundated with misinformation on social media, making a blog an opportunity to share detailed, accurate content that builds trust and positions you as an expert in your field.

## Commitment to Content

Moving forward, I plan to blog at least once a weekâ€”or more often, depending on my schedule. Rest assured, my posts will reflect my 20+ years of marketing and sales experience. No ChatGPT here; youâ€™ll get advice in my own words. Iâ€™m not a professional writer, so if grammar isnâ€™t perfect, know that my focus is on delivering practical marketing insights to help your business grow.
