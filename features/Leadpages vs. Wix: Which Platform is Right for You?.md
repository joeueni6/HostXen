## Leadpages Features: Why It Stands Out

While Leadpages is primarily known as a landing page builder, its wide range of features sets it apart. These capabilities make it a comprehensive marketing tool that can elevate your business.

### Professionally Designed Templates

Leadpages offers a wide selection of **high-converting templates** that are mobile-friendly and fully customizable. Whether you’re launching a product, collecting leads, or running an event, you’ll find templates tailored to your goals.

### LeadBoxes for Maximizing Conversions

A standout feature of Leadpages is **LeadBoxes**, pop-ups that you can embed across your digital assets such as blogs or websites. These pop-ups can be triggered in various ways:

- When a visitor clicks a button, link, or image.
- After a set amount of time on your site.
- When a visitor attempts to exit the page.

The **Exit Intent LeadBox** is especially useful, giving you one last opportunity to capture leads with compelling content before a visitor leaves.

### Built-in Facebook and Instagram Ad Creation

With Leadpages, you can create **Facebook and Instagram ads** directly within the platform. This feature simplifies your workflow by automating the ad creation process. Leadpages pulls content from your landing page, allowing you to customize the ad, then launches it seamlessly. You can even track conversions with automatic Facebook Pixel integration.

### A/B Testing for Optimized Performance

**Split testing** is an essential part of improving your marketing strategy. Leadpages makes it easy to test different versions of your landing pages to identify which design or copy resonates best with your audience. The built-in A/B testing tool ensures you’re maximizing conversions from your traffic.
