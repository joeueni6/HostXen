# Top Affiliate Programs with Recurring Commissions in 2025

Affiliate marketing offers the ultimate dream: earning passive income with minimal effort. By promoting products online, you can wake up to commissions earned while you sleep. This concept has been around for decades, but the internet has made it significantly more accessible.

Earning through **recurring affiliate programs** takes it a step further. Instead of earning a one-time commission, you can generate ongoing income from a single referral. If building passive income appeals to you, affiliate marketing is the way to go.

Below, we’ll explore the best affiliate programs with recurring commissions in 2022, how they work, and tips to maximize your success.

## What Are Recurring Affiliate Programs?

Traditional affiliate marketing often involves earning a commission from a single sale. However, **recurring affiliate programs** pay commissions repeatedly as long as the referred customer remains active.

For instance, if you refer a subscriber to a software product with a $20/month subscription, you’ll earn $20 each month they stay subscribed. Referring just five subscribers would yield $100 monthly, and this grows with each additional referral.

With recurring affiliate programs, your initial effort continues to generate income long after the sale.
